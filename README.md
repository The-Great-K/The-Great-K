- 👋 Hi, I’m @The-Great-K
- 👀 I’m interested in Minecraft, learning Java
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and Python (HTML, but is that considered learning?)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Minecraft stuff, maybe a video game created with Java
- 📫 How to reach me make an urgent issue on one of my projects

I don't really go to github that much, just to post stuff, if only someone would actually look at my stuff :(, then I'd be motivated to come
